# Multi-label-Biomedical-QC-Corpus

This hybrid dataset was developed for the task of multi-label lexical answer type prediction. The dataset uses the strengths of two datasets: [BioMEDLAT corpus](https://github.com/mariananeves/BioMedLAT) previously developed by Neves et al. and the automated corpus generation process of [OAQA system](https://github.com/oaqa/bioasq).
